# Helping Each Other Skill Up with Python
Have you tried starting an online Python course but ended up stopping halfway through? 

Join us as we support each other in our quest to become better Python programmers!  
We use free online courses and meet once a week to discuss problem sets and answer questions relating to Python.

We are currently studying course material from {{< courselink >}}.

See the [Getting Started page]({{< ref "/start.md" >}}) for information on joining our Meetup and Slack group.
