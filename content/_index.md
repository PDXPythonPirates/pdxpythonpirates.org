# Helping Each Other Skill Up with Python
Have you tried starting an online Python course but ended up stopping halfway through? 

Join us as we support each other in our quest to become better Python programmers!  We use free online courses and meet once a week to discuss problem sets and answer questions relating to Python.

We are currently studying course material from the learning path _Become a Python Developer_ on Lynda.com.

See the [Getting Started page]({{< ref "/start.md" >}}) for information on joining our Meetup and Slack group.

# Website Retiring Soon

This version of the website is retiring soon so we can make way for the new and improved **pythonpirates.org 2.0**.  
We would love for you to come help us create it!

Join our `#website` channel in Slack to find out more.
